Introduction
Welcome to the basic calculator app! This is a simple command line application written in Python that takes input from users and performs basic mathematical operations. The app runs in the terminal and allows users to perform calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Usage
To use the calculator, simply run the script in your terminal by typing python calculator.py. The app will prompt you to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /). Once you have entered the numbers and operator, the calculator will perform the calculation and display the result.

Requirements
This application requires Python 3 to be installed on your system. It has been tested on Python 3.8, but should work on any version of Python 3.

Limitations
The calculator currently only supports basic mathematical operations with two numbers. It does not handle more complex calculations or input validation. Additionally, it does not support floating point numbers.

Contributions
This is a basic calculator app and contributions are always welcome. If you have any suggestions for improvements or new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
